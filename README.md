# How-To-BootCamp
Quick How To as I go through my BootCamp Journey
To help myself and others make it through this class, I decided to make a step by step guide with screen shots for the harder concepts or tools. It's going to start rough and dirty because I am actually trying to get it done to help a friend submit his homework tonight. I will spend the next few weeks making it dry and incorporating more of what we learn, new tabs or sections, utilize new tools, etc. For tonight, this is my start for the page. 

## First submit
Make a list of how to create a repository in github, use terminal to clone to local machine, and then add and push files to the repository, and finally how to publish the pages so they are viewable by others. This page is UGLY!!! I mean really ugly. But that will be my next step and next commits.
