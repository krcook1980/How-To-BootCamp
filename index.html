        <h2>Creating and pushing to github repository</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Ok here we go! Let's make a repository! <br>
            <!-- Github login and create repository-->
            Please navigate to your <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">github.</a> Log
            in and you should see your main page.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step1.png">
            <br>
            Click the green New button in the left aside bar. Enter your repository name. Make it something useful that
            pertains to your content. Don't name a website about potatos something like spam. Put in a description, make
            sure it is public and check "Add a README file." Finally, click the green "Create repository."
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step2.png">
            <br>
            <!-- Terminal clone from github-->
            Great job, now... get that weird thing on your computer!!! Here is where you should be, click the green Code
            button.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step3.png">
            <br>
            Make sure you see the SSH underlined, and then copy that code you see "git@githb.com:......"
            <img src="assets/Step4.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            <!--GitBash-->
            OHHH boy, here we go with the "tough part". But don't worry we can do this! Open GitBash to get to your
            terminal. Very first thing... where are you? See that file path in yellow? It says I am in users/kelly.
            Where do we want to be? That is up to you. Where do you want to save this repository? For me, I am saving my
            work on my desktop in a folder called How To. So, that is where I want this repository.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step5.png">
            <br>
            So, I am going to type some commands here.<span class="span3">++</span> <br>
            cd means change directory, then I follow that with where I want
            to go.  You can do one folder at a time, or you can do the whole path if you know it. In your spare time,
            tinker with this, moving up and down through folders. Get comfortable with git, we will use it a lot. I
            forgot and put a space in my folder name and have not learned that part so... I got to as far as I remember
            for my folder path. So my command is <strong> cd c:/users/kelly/desktop</strong> Push enter. Now, the line
            says I am on my desktop... great start! <br>
            <img src="assets/Step6.png">
            <br>
            So now I need to find out what folders are in there. We are going to type <strong>ls</strong>. That means
            list files. A list
            of everything in that directory (or folder) comes up. Now I can simply type <strong>cd H </strong> and press
            tab ...and it should
            autofill the rest of that file for me.<span class="span3">++</span> Great, now push enter and I am in that How To folder!
            <br>
            <img src="assets/STep7.png" alt="">
            <br>
            Ok here goes the magic... you copied that code from the github page. Let's use it! We start off with the git
            ... that tells our terminal we are going to be using git. Clone means, I want a copy. And then, in "" the
            url to what you want (thats the code you copied). <br>Your command is <strong> git clone
                <span class="span1"> "git@github.com:whatever you copied goes here</span>"</strong> <br>Terminal sucks... it
            doesn't let you just paste with ctrl v... try ctrl, shift, v.
            <br><br><br>
            Did it work? If not, quick side note. Go to the top of your terminal in the white bar, right click,
            properties, and make sure Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste is checked.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step8.png">
            <br>
            Alright... this is what we should have. If you do... click enter!
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step9.png"><br>
            Ok, it's going! See that stuff... kinda... random looking? That means it worked!!!<span class="span3">++</span>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/step10.png"><br>
            <!-- get the files in the repository folder-->
            Now ... you can move files around in here but I am not that good yet so I am going to do it the old school
            "easy" way. Go to your file explorer (that's the manila folder that you use to find files before you knew
            what a terminal is.) Go to the folder that we were in on the terminal. For me, that was the How To folder.
            Now when I am there... I see my gitHub repository folder as well... How-To-BootCamp. I want to take any
            files
            that I am working on or want to upload to that repository and move them inside that new folder. Before:
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step11.png">
            <br>
            Click the file or folder you want, drag it into that new folder. Or cut and paste... whichever you prefer.
            None of those can be open or they won't move. After and when I look in that new folder:
            <br><br>
            <img src="assets/Step12.png">
            <br>
            <!-- Add, comment and push to github-->
            Great, back to the terminal. And here we go!!! Two things to do here. First, we need to get inside that new
            git folder so if you aren't sure, type ls again. We use <strong>cd and the folder </strong>. You will know
            you are in a
            repository file because now the address bar reads <span class="span1"> (main)</span> at the end... that's
            our "branch"
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step13.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            Now to get those files in there.<br>

            1) you can add one file at a time by git add filename.filetype... for example if I only want my index file
            in there, it would read git add index.html. BUT 2) if you want everything in your folder then it is easier
            to do <strong>git add .</strong> &nbsp You need the period, it means add everything. Now press enter. <br>
            <img src="assets/Step14.png">
            <br>
            Good job if you see this weird crap. Someday we will know what it means! Now... we are going to make the
            note that shows up to other people
            about what changes we made to the file. This is important, try not to skip it. So we are going to do git
            commit (when we push things its called commiting) and then -m to say message and our message in "". Again,
            you want this to be useful information here. Don't write a dad joke in there. Explain what you did to the
            file you are commiting or what it is. <br> Your command is <strong>git commit -m "Very informative message
                here"</strong> Like so: <br>
            <img src="assets/Step15.png">
            <br>
            and push enter... if it did it right, you will have all kinds of stuff there. <br>
            <img src="assets/Step16.png">
            <br>
            Almost there, hang in with me. Last thing... in the terminal we are going to do <strong>git push origin main
            </strong>If for
            some reason this doesn't work, we can trouble shoot, but in general it should. It will probably ask you for
            a password, that is your github password.<br>
            <img src="assets/Step 17.png">
            <br>

            There ya have it... now... final step so others can see your stuff! If you don't see your files, try
            refreshing the page if you never closed it from above. Now click on settings.<br>
            <img src="assets/Step18.png">
            <br>
            Scroll down to the bottom just above the red boxed Danger Zone you will see GitHub Pages. Inside change the
            box from None to Main. Click Save. When that thing changes green... it is live to share with that url
            listed. <br>***If it won't go green after a while, change it back to none, save, main, save, refresh til it
            turns
            green.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Step19.png">
            <br>

            <span class="span2"> ****Now, super important, go back to your code tab and click the little pencil on the
                README. Be
                descriptive: What is this project, what did you do, why did you do it? Screen shots are great, reference
                anyones code you used, etc. A bad read me will drop your grade... make it a good one. </span><span class="span3">++</span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 id="random">Random side notes:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        1) If you misspell something in the terminal it usually gives you hints on what you should have typed or what you
        need to do first if you are missing a step.
        <br>
        2) When I was navigating to my file and I said cd H ... I said H because my folder starts with H "How To BootCamp". But if your repository is named Potatos, you would do cd P and push tab. <br>
        IF that is not the folder you wanted, DO NOT push enter, erase and try again, maybe type more of the name and then tab.<br>
        3) If you do the clone and you do not get that info, or it gives you an error asking about a password, that means your SSH key isn't set up and that is another project for another day... I'll get it in here if it is needed.
        <br>
        4) For the homework, go to bootcampspot and you need to submit 2 urls. First is the live site in that green published section. The second is the url to your github respository, so just click back to it and copy it right out of the address bar. Mine for this page is: <a href="https://github.com/krcook1980/How-To-BootCamp" target="blank">https://github.com/krcook1980/How-To-BootCamp</a>
